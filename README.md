# Helmet-and-Number-Plate-Detection

## üß† Description
This project focuses on detecting traffic violations by identifying motorbike riders who are not wearing helmets and extracting their license plate information.  
It integrates three key models:
1. **Moto_Detect_Model** ‚Äì Detects motorcycles in traffic images.
2. **Helmet_LP_Detect_Model** ‚Äì Detects helmets, no-helmet cases, and license plates.
3. **ReadLP_Model** ‚Äì Reads license plate text using OCR techniques.

These models are combined in a logical pipeline to enable real-time helmet violation detection from videos.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview and Explanation

### **Model 1: Detect Motorcycle using YOLOv8**
- **Input:** Traffic images containing multiple vehicles.  
- **Output:** Bounding boxes around motorcycles.  
- **Implementation Approach:**  
  - Dataset collected via personal cameras and processed into frames.
  - Labeled using **Roboflow** to create a clean motorcycle dataset.
  - Trained with **YOLOv8**, achieving strong motorcycle detection accuracy.
  - Added a screen threshold to filter out motorcycles too far from the camera for reliable plate recognition.

### **Model 2: Detect Helmet and License Plate using YOLOv8**
- **Input:** Cropped motorcycle images from Model 1 output.  
- **Output:** Bounding boxes for **Helmet**, **No-Helmet**, and **License Plate**.  
- **Implementation Approach:**  
  - Extracted motorcycles using bounding box coordinates.
  - Created a helmet dataset by combining back-head images and manually labeled helmet/no-helmet examples.
  - Used **Roboflow** for labeling and trained YOLOv8 to detect helmets and license plates effectively.

### **Model 3: Read License Plate using VGG16 (OCR Process)**
- **Input:** Cropped license plate images.  
- **Output:** Alphanumeric text of the license plate.  
- **Implementation Approach:**  
  - Used a custom character dataset (A‚ÄìZ, 0‚Äì9) for training.
  - Applied preprocessing (contrast enhancement, noise reduction, contour extraction).
  - Segmented license plate characters and passed them through **VGG16** for recognition.

## üíª GUI Design
A simple GUI was developed using **PyQt5**, allowing users to:
- Upload traffic videos.
- Detect helmet violations in real time.
- Display detected violations and corresponding license plates.
- Generate reports and statistics based on time and location.
